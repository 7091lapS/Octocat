Explain what a branch is, in your own words

A branch is like a fork in the history of the project. When a branch is created, it's as if from that moment a bookmark of the current state of the project is created, and new changes can then be made both on the master branch and on the new branch. The changes on the new branch don't affect the master branch and are independent from the original project, but can be merged together with the master branch.
